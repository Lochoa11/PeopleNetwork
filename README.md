This project is from Day 60 of Paul Hudson's 100 days of SwiftUI. The project required me to make a GET request and download JSON data from a server from Hacking with Swift of random data of people and their information. The next step was then displaying that data to the user with each person's details shown in another screen. Furthermore that new screen would show who they're friends with.

A video of the project after doing the challenges can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPzwhrEgI2E)
